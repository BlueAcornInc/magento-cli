Magento-cli provides a globally-installed cli tool for managing magento locally. This includes serving it locally (`magento serve`), and helpers to install magento. As well as convienences to other tools, such as `magento sql` to access `mysql-cli`, and to install `composer` and `n98-magerun2`. This tool also passes through commands to the `bin/magento` tool in the working directory, allowing it to serve as a one-stop magento shop.

<h1 class="text-center">Rationale</h1>
<p>Docker is typically the preferred method for running Magento locally. It's great because it lets you containerize all the services required to run Magento, and even run them concurrently using a reverse proxy like traefik with goodies like tls and all that.</p> 

<p>On Linux, docker works exceptionally well with near-native performance. On other platforms, however, it's typical for docker to run within a VM which significantly impacts performance. On these platforms, there's typically a lot of performance lost through volume mounting (the Magento codebase is hundreds of megs of small text files). This can be relieved somewhat with `mutagen`, a file syncing service that copies files back and forth between your local and the container - causing a delay in updates and frustration when things don't reflect on the frontend. Further still, when the docker service containers aren't compiled for your system arch (M1/ARM7/x64) the performance losses mounts.</p>

<p>Considering other popular languages and frameworks, like this `hugo` documentation site as an example, it's written in golang and when you want to serve the blog locally, you run `hugo serve` which spawns a web server and provides a url. `pwa-studio` works the same way with `webpack`, it's a popular convention. Let's provide the same convention, and support using php's built-in web server as a way to serve Magento. We can still provide docker-backed services, even a php-fpm service (with mutagen, if you insist) to round things out. But this project differentiates from others because it has first-class support for pre-compiled php binaries. These are provided by `brew` and `phpbrew` by the way, easy to install, you can still run multiple php versions concurrently, and they are substantially faster than running it in a multi-arch docker container.</p>
