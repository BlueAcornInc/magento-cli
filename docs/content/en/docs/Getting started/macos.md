Requires `php`, `docker` and `docker-compose`.

Install `docker` and `docker-compose` using the [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/).

The author also uses [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to manage the environment variables required for use, check out `.envrc.sample` for defaults.

Review the [Homebrew Installation Article](/magento-cli/docs/local-php/homebrew/) for more information on how to confgiure PHP using this tool.
